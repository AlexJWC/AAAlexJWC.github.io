Days pass by and my eyes stay dry, and I think that I'm okay

泪眼逐日干枯 芜杂内心逐渐平静

'Till I find myself in conversation fading away

直到发现自己缥缈在过去的言辞之中

The way you smile

你的笑容

The way you walk

你的步姿

The time you took

你的光阴

To teach me all that you had taught

反复在脑海中徘徊

Tell me, how am I supposed to move on？

告诉我该如何继续人生

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate

这些日子 我成为了自己讨厌的人

Wishing you were around but now it's too late

希望你在身旁 但为时已晚

My mind is a place that can't escape your ghost

你的模样缠绕徘徊在我的脑海之中

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away-ay-ay

有时我希望能摆脱这一切

One more rainy day without you

又是溢满泪水的一天

Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day

有时我希望能再见你一面

One more rainy day

又是溢满泪水的一天

Oh, I'm a wreck without you here

没了你 我残缺不全

Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone

自从你走的那一刻 我残缺不全

I've tried to put this all behind me

我尝试将一切抛之脑后

I think was wrecked all along

一直以来从未完整

Yeah, I'm a wreck (wreck, wreck, wreck, wreck)

我残缺不全 残缺不全

They say that the time will heal it

他们说时间治愈一切

The pain will go away

痛苦会随之而去

But everything, it reminds me of you

然而一切 将你刻入我的脑海中

And it comes in waves

回忆波涛而来

The way you laugh when your shoulders shook

你的笑容 抖动的肩膀

The time you took

与你在一起的日子

To teach me all that you had taught

反复在脑海中徘徊

Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?

告诉我该如何继续人生

These days I'm becoming everything that I hate

这些日子 我成为了自己讨厌的人

Wishing you were around but now it's too late

希望你在身旁 但为时已晚

My mind is a place that can't escape your ghost

你的模样缠绕徘徊在我的脑海之中

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away-ay-ay

有时我希望能摆脱这一切

One more rainy day without you

又是溢满泪水的一天

Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day

有时我希望能再见你一面

One more rainy day

又是溢满泪水的一天

Oh, I'm a wreck without you here

没了你 我残缺不全

Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone

自从你走的那一刻 我残缺不全

I've tried to put this all behind me

我尝试将一切抛之脑后

I think was wrecked all along

一直以来从未完整

These days when I'm on the brink of the edge

这些日子 我行走于思想边缘

I remember the words that you said

仍记得你的话语

"Remember the life you led"

“过你自己的生活”

You'd say, "Oh, suck it all up, don't get stuck in the mud

你会说，“去他的，别陷入情感的泥潭”

Thinking of things that you should have done"

想想你曾应做的事

I'll see you again my loved one

我愿再见你一面 爱人

I'll see you again my loved one

我愿再见你一面 爱人

Yeah I'm a wreck

我残缺不全

I'll see you again my loved one (I'll see you again my loved one)

我愿再见你一面 爱人...

Oh I'm a wreck without you here

没了你 我残缺不全

Yeah I'm a wreck since you been gone (Since you've been gone)

自从你走的那一刻 我残缺不全(自从你走的那一刻)

I've tried to put this all behind me

我尝试将一切抛之脑后

I think was wrecked all along

一直以来从未完整

Yeah I'm a wreck

我残缺不全

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away-ay-ay (But I can't)

有时我希望能摆脱这一切（但我做不到）

One more rainy day without you (Rainy day)

又是溢满泪水的一天（泪水）

Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day (But I can't)

有时我希望能再见你一面（但我无能为力）

One more rainy day

又是溢满泪水的一天
